# DSA Resources 

Resources I found helpful for myself and also famous ones I found online but might not have tried.

My Suggestions:

1. Leetcode, ofc. for PRACTICE
   https://leetcode.com/problemset/
   why?
   - test engine is good - compares your Time complexity and Space complexity against other users' submissions - you can also view the submission that did better 
     than yours.
   - Users: check solutions for different approaches and discussion sections for quick chuckles. 
   - I personally like the UI and also, feels authentic (I probably got influenced).

2. GeeksForGeeks, again, ofc. to LEARN/UNDERSTAND
   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/geeksforgeeks-practice-best-online-coding-platform/
   why?
   - BEST : for most of the problems, under related articles secttion, you can find **a GFG article** that has probably all possible approaches (naive/brute force,        alternate, expected) with a detailed explanation of the idea behind, step-by-step notes and slides, 
   - **Company tags**, unlike Leetcode you don't need premium to unlock company tags.
